# Digit Recognition: 
In this project I created Digit recognition

## How I approached the project: 
I used P5 for graphics and python for back end and connected it with Flask
 
## Reflection on the challenges I faced: 
It was hard to get the http requests between Python and Javascript, and I was also getting some issues with getting an Error when the canvas drawn didn't look like any digit. To fix this, instead of having the outputs be 0 and 1, I changed it to 1 and -1 to allow for greater difference if it the neuron was activated or if the neuron was not activated
