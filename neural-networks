# Neural Networks: 
In this project, we made an artificial neural network to classify a double half moon.

## How I approached the project: 
I decided to do this project in Python, more specifically, I used the tensorflow library for my neural network and a
couple other libraries for data management (pandas, scikit etc.). I ended doing 5 hidden layers with 10 neurons each
along side with a relu activation function
 
## Reflection on the challenges I faced: 
The biggest problem i faced was classifying the double half moon without any error. To do this, I just increased the
number of neurons in the hidden layers and I changed the activation function to relu instead of tanh.
