# The Hexagon Game: 
In this project, I utilized the greedy search (using heuristic) to make a game of a hexagon grid. You spawn in in the center of the map, which is a radius of hexagons, and you must reach the green hexagon without touching the red ones.

## How I approached the project: 
I decided to do this project in Javascript, more specifically using the p5.js library since it was a simple way to integrate graphics. 
 
## Reflection on the challenges I faced: 
The hardest challenge came at creating the hexagon grid. I decided to use three parameters, x, y and z, instead of just x and y.

I used this website to help me. I used the cube coordinates.
