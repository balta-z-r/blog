# Neural Networks:

In this project, we made an artificial neural network to classify a double half moon.

## How I approached the project:

I decided to do this project in Python, more specifically, I used the tensorflow library for my neural network and a
couple other libraries for data management (pandas, scikit etc.). I ended doing 5 hidden layers with 10 neurons each
along side with a relu activation function.

I also used Jupyter which allowed me to present my work in a comprehensive and easy to understand manner with Markdown
text explaining what each section of code does.
You can view the Jupyter Notebook in my source code.

## Reflection on the challenges I faced:

The biggest problem i faced was classifying the double half moon without any error. To do this, I just increased the
number of neurons in the hidden layers and I changed the activation function to relu instead of tanh.
